# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis of global COVID-19 data to understand pandemic trends, country comparisons, and regional patterns over time.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and processed global COVID-19 time series data
- Analyzed global case and death trends
- Compared country-level responses and case trajectories
- Examined regional patterns and mortality rates
- Identified key pandemic waves and patterns

## What I Found
- Distinct waves in global case trends over time
- Certain countries experienced disproportionate case loads
- Clear regional differences in case rates and mortality
- Countries followed different trajectories in their pandemic response

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation and time series analysis
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Data cleaning and transformation techniques

## Key Insights
- Global cooperation is crucial for pandemic response
- Early intervention significantly impacts outcomes
- Data tracking enables better public health planning
- Regional approaches should be tailored to local conditions
